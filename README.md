# AI-Resources
Introduction

AI is becoming a very large and fast moving area that is rapidly changing all of our lives.  This list of resources is intended to help people getting started to know where to go, and to help minimise the early problems of deciding what approach to take.

I intend to keep it as up to date as possible, however, if anybody find links that are out of date or finds some solutions that are better than the ones I have suggested please let me know.

The Environment

Whilst there are many machine learning and AI frameworks out there it seems to me that the centre of mass is in the Python open source community. There are resources based around R – mainly used by people that have come from a data science background, and there are resources based around Matlab and its open source equivalent Octave.  My recommendation, however, would be for somebody to start with Python since this seems to be the way it is going and where I seem most examples / open-source applications.

Whichever language you choose to use you will need to setup a local environment and code editor.  I would suggest the following but there are many others to choose from:

Anaconda-navigator  
This very useful framework lets you setup a dedicated environment for a particular application, and they helps to load all of the required libraries and keep this up to date.  If you wish to use different frameworks (see section further down) you will find that each framework seems to need different versions of libraries and hence unless you have a dedicated one for each it is very difficult to get them all to work properly.  Anaconda navigator makes this easy to manage. It also provides ready and easy access to other resources that are useful and include:
•	Jupyter Notebooks.
•	iPython Console.  An interactive Python console that supports inline figures syntax highlighting etc.  It is often useful to use a notebook and a console with the same session.
•	Spyder – scientific python development IDE.  Has good features including debugging but I find Pycharm more capable
•	Orange – a shareware graphical data mining and analysis tool

Jupyter notebooks are a very useful tool that allow software to be written and run in a web browser and also facilitate effective narration of what is happening in the code (much more so than the old comments that traditional programmers rely upon).  It also allows a good blend of interactive and scripted coding.  For this reason such notebooks are extensively used for tutorials and examples.  Personally, I like the way this works with a couple of caveats. First code auto-complete does not work (or at least I haven’t found a way to make it do so).  Secondly, I find debugging with notebooks very cumbersome compared to traditional software tools.
To overcome the latter limitations, I also make extensive use of another free resource called PyCharm.  Pycharm is a more traditional IDE which works very well with Python and has excellent code completion, debugging and project management tools

Anaconda-navigator is supplied by Continiuum Dynamics Inc and can be downloaded from here

PyCharm can be downloaded from here. Note that I have found the community free version perfectly ok for my needs
